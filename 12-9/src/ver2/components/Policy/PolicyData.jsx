          <div className="font-bold">6.2. Your Privacy Rights</div>
          <p>
            In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to: ‍{" "}
            <br />
            (a) Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data
            subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the
            personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
            processing it. <br />
            (b) Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
            This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold
            about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of
            the new data you provide to us. <br />
            (c) Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask
            us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason
            for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us
            to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully
            exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we
            may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
            required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
            however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request
            of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you,
            if applicable, at the time of your request. <br />
            (d) Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying
            on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
            something about your particular situation which makes you want to
            object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
            fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
            where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
            purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
            legitimate grounds to process your information which override your
            rights and freedoms. <br />
            (e) Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
            enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
            data in the following scenarios: <br />
            i. if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; <br />
            ii. where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to
            erase it; <br />
            iii. where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require
            it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;
            <br />
            iv. you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
            whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. <br />
            (f) Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
            party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
            your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
            format. Note that this right only applies to automated information
            which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
            the information to perform a contract with you. <br />
            (g) Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
            process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
            lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
            consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
            certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is
            the case at the time you withdraw your consent. <br />
            If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us
            as set forth in Section 15 below. We will process such requests in
            accordance with applicable laws.

        <p>
          We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and
          in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Unfortunately, no system is
          100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
          information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by
          applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized
          disclosure. <br />
          By using our Services or providing personal information to us, you
          agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding
          security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of
          our Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may
          attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on our
          Services, by mail or by sending an email to you.

        <div className="font-bold">8. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</div>
        <p>
          Many of our external third parties are based outside the UK so their
          processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data
          outside the UK. We may transfer your personal data to our group
          companies that are located outside the UK, including, but not limited,
          in the United States, or other countries, which may have data
          protection laws that are different from the laws where you live.
          <br />
          Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a
          similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
          one of the following safeguards is implemented: <br />
          (a) We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
          been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
          data. <br />
          (b) Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
          contracts approved by the UK which give personal data the same
          protection it has in the UK. <br />
          Please contact us if you want further information on the specific
          mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the
          UK.

        <p>
          We may store the personal information we collect as described in this
          Privacy Notice for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to
          fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our
          Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits,
          pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and
          comply with applicable laws. <br />
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may store biometric data for three
          (3) years.
